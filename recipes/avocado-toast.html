    <p>We’re going back to basics this summer, so let’s talk about avocado toast! Creamy avocado spread onto well-toasted bread is one of my favorite quick meals. Actually, it’s one of my favorite meals in general. It’s so delicious, I’d call it one of life’s simplest pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>Lets start with the process shall we, all you'll need to do is...</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Pick great avocados</li>

        <li> Don’t forget the salt</li>
    </ol>
